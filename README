 NGramSearch
=============


Description
===========

NGramSearch retrieves items that are similar to a query, based on
N-Gram similarity.  The items and query may be strings, or any object
that can be transformed to a string by means of the `item_transform` and
`query_transform` parameters.

The algorithm is derived from Perl's String::Trigram module.  The
NGramSearch module is a rewrite of the python-ngram_ module, designed
to support queries for arbitrary objects.
