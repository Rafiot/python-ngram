A module inspired by String::Trigram (Perl) to get a similarity between two strings

usage:

>>> from ngram import ngram
>>> help(ngram)

I could not yet be bothered to copy all the text here. The online help should
suffice for now. I will expand sometime soon (I guess).

Otherwise refer to the URL given in the class description of ngram.
