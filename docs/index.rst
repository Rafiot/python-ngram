Introduction
============

The :class:`~ngram.NGram` class is a set that supports searching for
its members by N-Gram string similarity. It is a full subclass of the
built-in `set` that maintains N-Gram indexing on all set
operations. The algorithm is based from `String::Trigram
<http://search.cpan.org/dist/String-Trigram/>`_ by Tarek Ahmed.

NGram up to version 2.0.0b2 was written by Michel Albert, and since
then has had a major rewrite and been maintained by Graham Poulter:
see `Changes in Version 3`_

NGram is hosted at the `Python Package Index
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ngram>`_, and this is the online
documentation.

Installation
============

Simple way is to install from `PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/ngram>`_::

   easy_install ngram

Or download the source tarball from PyPI and install locally::

   python setup.py install --prefix=$HOME/.local

With source you can build documentation in `docs/_build/html`::

   python setup.py build_sphinx
